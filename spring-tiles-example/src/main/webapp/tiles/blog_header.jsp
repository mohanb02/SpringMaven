<h1 class="blog-title">The Composite View Pattern</h1>
<p class="lead blog-description">
	All websites have something in common: 
	they are made of pages that share similar structures. 
	The pages share the same layout, while each page is made of different independent pieces, but always placed in the same position across all the site.
	The Composite View pattern formalizes this typical use, by allowing to create pages that have a similar structure, in which each section of the page vary in different situations.
